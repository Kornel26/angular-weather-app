# Weather app

Your task is to create a simple weather app in angular.

- At first the data could be hardcoded, but later on use a free weather API (e.g.: https://openweathermap.org/api) or at least the json-server package (or mock server) to fake a rest API.

- The App should have a fixed header with the navigation menu items. 

- All menu items should be routed to a different route.
                - If the user tries to navigate to a non-existent route, the router should fall back to the home or main page.
                
- The Header should contain a dropdown to select the city/country of which the weather info the app is going to display. The default should be Bud/hun

- On the right hand side a fixed section should display historical weather statistics.


1. The main(landing) page should be the first item on the menu by default (Today), and should contain:
                - information about the current weather
                - the hourly forecast for the given day.

2. The second page (Weekly) should display the weekly weather and should display the weekly weather forecast.

3. Page 3 is optional.

Important: 
- Feel free to tweak features or add more features if you like. The goal is to try out the basic angular dev techniques.
- The design implementation is completely up to you, but please make it more appealing than just naked html. You can use angular material(preferably) or any other package of your choice.

Useful vscode extensions (optional):
                - Prettier
                - Angular Language Service
                - Thunder Client (for API testing. Use Postman alternatively)
                - Git Graph
                - Editor Config
                
Tip: Use weather.com or any other website for inspiration.
